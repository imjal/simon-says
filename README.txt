Dr. Aldawud,

This project took so long for me to complete, I apologize for it being so late
and taking time out of your summer. It took so long to do the display colors method,
because sleeping the thread wasn't going to work with the UI, and I had so many issues
with Animations and it finally worked this morning. I hope you give us full credit even 
though it is really late. I learned alot doing this project and I hope this project is evidence,
and I look forward to havingyou again next year!

Have a great summer!

Jessica Lee

ps: I apologize for the very bad design on this project, it's my first time using GUI.
